Telecom Capstone Project

1. Performance Analysis: This part focuses on creating dynamic dashboards to analyze and visualize KPIs related to telecom tariffs, such as total revenue, voice, data, on-net, and off-net revenue per subscriber. 
Key features of this dashboard include weekly and daily performance insights, comparison across tariffs, and alerts for changes in KPI trends.

2. Voice Revenue Analysis: This part addresses a decline in total voice duration. Using data on subscriber usage across various tariffs, the project requires dashboards to explore possible reasons behind the decline.
